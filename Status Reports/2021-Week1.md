**Student's Name:** Krushnal

**Mentor:** Walter

**Project:** Atom

**Project Description:** Really? How many times do I have to copy this

**Problem Definition:** Is this meant to be for the week's goals or the entire project?

**Deliverables** Similarly is this meant to be for the whole project or just this week? 

**Coding Plan**

| Week | Tasks | Goals |
|------|-------|-------|
| _Week 1_ | _Task 1_ | _Goal 1_ |
| ... | ... | ... |

...Maybe I am misunderstanding. Is this report meant to be for the whole project or a week by week thing?
